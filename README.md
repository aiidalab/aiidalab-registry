This repository contains the **source code** of the official App registry for the [AiiDAlab](https://www.materialscloud.org/aiidalab).

## Adding an app to the registry

Apps are added to the registry by adding an entry to the `apps.yaml` file within this repository.

*Feel free to propose a new app category to be added to [`category.yaml`](https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-registry/edit/main/categories.yaml) before or after adding your app.*

1. Create a pull request to this repository that adds a new entry to the `apps.yaml` file, e.g., by [editing the file directly in the browser](https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-registry/edit/main/apps.yaml?message=Add%20app%20%3Capp-name%3E). Example:

    ```yaml
    hello-world:
      metadata:
        title: AiiDAlab hello world app
        description: |
            The hello world app demonstrates how to develop and
            register an app for AiiDAlab.
        authors: A. Doe, B. Doe
        external_url: https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-hello-world
        documentation_url: https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-hello-world#readme
        logo: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-widgets-base/master/miscellaneous/logos/aiidalab.png
        state: stable
      categories:
        - tutorials
      git_url:
        https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-hello-world.git
    ```

    **Note**: Only the metadata fields `title` and `description` are mandatory.

2. Your app will show up in the [AiiDAlab App Store](http://aiidalab.github.io/aiidalab-registry) once your pull request is approved and merged.

**Tip**: The app store supports the `$ref` syntax to reference externally hosted documents.
That means you can reference metadata that is hosted at a different location, which makes it easier to dynamically update it.
For example, if you place a `metadata.yaml` file within your app repository, then you can reference that file in the app store like this:

```yaml
hello-world:
  metadata:
    $ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-hello-world/master/metadata.yaml
```
You can even reference only parts of the metadata, example:
```yaml
hello-world:
  metadata:
    title: AiiDAlab hello world app
    description:
      $ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-hello-world/master/metadata.yaml#description
my-big-map-app:
```

*The app store will assume that external references are in JSON format unless the referenced path ends with `.yaml` or `.yml`.*

### Valid keys for app entries in `apps.yaml`

| Key | Requirement | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| `metadata` | **Mandatory** | General description of the app (see below). |
| `git_url` | **Mandatory** | Link to the source code git repository. |
| `categories` | Optional | If provided, must be one of the valid categories specified in [`categories.yaml`](https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-registry/blob/main/categories.yaml). |


### Valid keys for app metadata:

| Key | Requirement | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| `title` | **Mandatory** | The title will be displayed in the list of apps in the application manager. |
| `description` | **Mandatory** | The description will be displayed on the detail page of your app. |
| `authors` | Optional | Comma-separated list of authors. |
| `logo` | Optional | Url to a logo file (png or jpg). |
| `state` | Optional | One of<br>- `registered`: lowest level - app may not yet be in a working state. Use this to secure a specific name.<br>- `development`: app is under active development, expect the occasional bug.<br>- `stable`: app can be used in production. |
| `documentation_url` | Optional | The link to the online documentation of the app (e.g. on [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)). |
| `external_url` | Optional | General homepage for your app. |

## Information for maintainers

To prepare a development environment, please run the following steps:
```console
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt -r tests/requirements.txt
$ pre-commit install
```

This will install all requirements needed to run the git pre-commit hooks (linters), build the website locally, and execute the test framework.

To execute tests, run:
```console
$ PYTHONPATH=src pytest
```

Executed tests include unit, integration, and validation tests.
The validation tests check the validity of all schema files, the data files (e.g. `apps.yaml` and `categories.yaml`, and – if present – the configuration file (`config.yaml`).

To generate the website, simply execute the following script:

```console
$ python src/build.py
```

The continuous-integration workflow is implemented with GitHub actions, which runs the pre-commit hooks, unit, integration, and validation tests.
In addition, all commits on the `main` branch are automatically deployed to GitHub pages.

### Versioning and migrations

* The public registry API specification is maintained under `src/static/api/openapi-v{version}.yaml`.
* The public registry API is published at `api/v{version}/` and is considered user-facing.
* The versioning of the API is semantic and all versions within one major version are backwards-compatible.
* The schemas for JSON files and responses are maintained within the repository at `src/static/schemas/v{version}/` and the tree version number should correspond to the API with the same major version number.
* The schemas are considered implementation detail, but updates must still be made with care as the public API relies on some of the schemas.
* Should the number of apps maintained within this registry grow substantially, a re-implementation of the registry as a database application with RESTful API server should be considered. Such a re-implementation would likely require a migration to a new server (see next point).
* For a migration to a different server both the old and the new registry should be kept online concurrently during a reasonable transition phase.
